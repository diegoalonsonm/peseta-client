# Peseta (client)

Welcome to Peseta. This app is the best app available for you to keep track of your finances logging your incomes and expenses to maintain a positive balance each month. You would also see all your stats through charts so you can have a more visual understanding on how you are using all your money.

This repo hosts the client side of the application. This app is intended to be a PWA to give the user a much better and native experience while using the application on their devices without making them feel that they are on a browser. 

The tech stack for the client development of the app is the following:
- Next JS
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap Icons
- Axios
